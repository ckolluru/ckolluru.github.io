Introduction
======

I recently got interested in learning more about graph neural network problems. The following blog posts are to help me document my learning along the way.

I'm following Dr. Leskovec's video lectures and course notes at Stanford (CS224W). Link to the playlist and course notes are below.

Course notes: https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2021/

Previous offerings of the course also seem to be available, although the class content seems to have been modified around a bit.

In the next blog posts, I'll summarize my learnings as I go - it should be possible to find them using the `tags` specified below.
